# Apache Felix

The **Apache Felix** project is a collection of semi-related **OSGi** sub-projects that build and release individually.

## Felix Framework

The flagship project is the **Apache Felix Framework** which implements the [**OSGi Core R7**](https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/7.0.0/) specification. The `/framework` directory contains the source and build tree for the **OSGi**-compliant
framework implementation.

Directly related projects:

- **main** `/main*` - provides an executable jar that launches the Felix framework.

## OSGi Core

- [**Log Service**](https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/8.0.0/service.log.html) `/log*`
- [**Resolver**](https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/7.0.0/service.resolver.html) `/resolver`

## OSGi Compendium

Several sub-projects cover various [**OSGi Compendium**](https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/) specifications such as:

- [**Configuration Admin**](https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.cm.html) `/configadmin`

- [**IO**](https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.io.html) `/io`
- [**Metatype**](https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.metatype.html) `/metatype`
- [**Preferences**](https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.prefs.html) `/prefs`
- [**UPnP**](https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.upnp.html) `/upnp`

- [**Wire Admin**](https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.wireadmin.html) `/wireadmin`

## Extra Features

Several projects provide extra features to an OSGi runtime.

- **bundle repository** `/bundlerepository` - Bundle repository service.
- **connect** `/connect` - A service registry that enables OSGi style service registry programs without using an OSGi framework.
- **dependency manager** `/dependencymanager` - A versatile java API, allowing to declaratively
  register, acquire, and manage dynamic OSGi services.
- **fileinstall** `/fileinstall*` - A utility to automatically install bundles from a directory.
- **gogo** `/gogo` - A command line shell, runtime and set of base commands for interacting with and introspecting an OSGi framework.
- **health checks** `/healthcheck/*` - An extensible framework to monitor the status of the OSGi container at runtime. (contains **systemready**)
- **inventory** `/inventory` - Provides some mechanisms to get the current state of the system and therefore provides an inventory of the system.
- **ipojo** `/ipojo` - A *service component runtime* aiming to simplify OSGi application development.
- **jaas support** `/jaas` - Bundle to simplify JAAS usage within OSGi environment.
- **logback** `/logback` - A simple integration of the OSGi R7 Log (1.4) service to Logback backend.
- **OSGi metrics** `/metrics/osgi` - Collecting and publishing metrics related to OSGi applications
- **rootcause** `/rootcause` - Finding the root cause of problems with OSGi declarative services components.
- **utils** `/utils` - Utility classes for OSGi (intended for embedding within other bundles.)
- **webconsole** `/webconsole*` - Web Based Management Console for OSGi Frameworks.
- and many other **OSGi** things

## Build tools

The `/tools` directory contains various build tools.

- **maven-bundle-plugin** `/tools/maven-bundle-plugin` - A maven plugin for building **OSGi** bundles.
- **osgicheck-maven-plugin** `/tools/osgicheck-maven-plugin` - Maven plugin for checking several OSGi aspects of your project.

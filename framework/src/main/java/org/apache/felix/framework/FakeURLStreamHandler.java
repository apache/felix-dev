/**
 * This class implements a fake stream handler. This class is necessary in
 * some cases when assigning <tt>CodeSource</tt>s to classes in
 * <tt>BundleClassLoader</tt>. In general, the bundle location is an URL
 * and this URL is used as the code source for the bundle's associated
 * classes. The OSGi specification does not require that the bundle
 * location be an URL, though, so in that case we try to generate a
 * fake URL for the code source of the bundle, which is just the location
 * string prepended with the "location:" protocol, by default. We need
 * this fake handler to avoid an unknown protocol exception.

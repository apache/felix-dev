/**
 * <p>
 * This class implements an abstract revision of a bundle archive. A revision
 * is an abstraction of a bundle's actual content and is associated with a
 * parent bundle archive. A bundle archive may have multiple revisions assocaited
 * with it at one time, since updating a bundle results in a new version of the
 * bundle's content until the bundle is refreshed. Upon a refresh, then old
 * revisions are then purged. This abstract class is the base class for all
 * concrete types of revisions, such as ones for a JAR file or directories. All
 * revisions are assigned a root directory into which all of their state should
 * be stored, if necessary. Clean up of this directory is the responsibility
 * of the parent bundle archive and not of the revision itself.

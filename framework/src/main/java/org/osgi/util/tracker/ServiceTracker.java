/**
 * The {@code ServiceTracker} class simplifies using services from the
 * Framework's service registry.
 * <p>
 * A {@code ServiceTracker} object is constructed with search criteria and a
 * {@code ServiceTrackerCustomizer} object. A {@code ServiceTracker} can use a
 * {@code ServiceTrackerCustomizer} to customize the service objects to be
 * tracked. The {@code ServiceTracker} can then be opened to begin tracking all
 * services in the Framework's service registry that match the specified search
 * criteria. The {@code ServiceTracker} correctly handles all of the details of
 * listening to {@code ServiceEvent}s and getting and ungetting services.
 * <p>
 * The {@code getServiceReferences} method can be called to get references to
 * the services being tracked. The {@code getService} and {@code getServices}
 * methods can be called to get the service objects for the tracked service.
 * <p>
 * The {@code ServiceTracker} class is thread-safe. It does not call a
 * {@code ServiceTrackerCustomizer} while holding any locks.
 * {@code ServiceTrackerCustomizer} implementations must also be thread-safe.
 * 
 * @param <S> The type of the service being tracked.
 * @param <T> The type of the tracked object.
 * @ThreadSafe

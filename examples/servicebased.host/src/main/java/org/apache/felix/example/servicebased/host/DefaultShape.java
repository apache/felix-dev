/**
 * This class is used as a proxy to defer object creation from shape
 * provider bundles and also as a placeholder shape when previously
 * used shapes are no longer available. These two purposes are
 * actually orthogonal, but were combined into a single class to
 * reduce the number of classes in the application. The proxy-related
 * functionality is introduced as a way to lazily create shape
 * objects in an effort to improve performance; this level of
 * indirection could be removed if eager creation of objects is not
 * a concern. Since this application uses the service-based extension
 * approach, lazy shape creation will only come into effect if
 * service providers register service factories instead of directly
 * registering <tt>SimpleShape</tt> or if they use a technology like
 * Declarative Services or iPOJO to register services. Since the
 * example providers register service instances directly there is
 * no laziness in the example, but the proxy approach is still used
 * to demonstrate how to make laziness possible and to keep it
 * similar to the extender-based approach.

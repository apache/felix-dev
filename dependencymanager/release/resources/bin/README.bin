Welcome to Apache Felix Dependency Manager
==========================================

Apache Felix Dependency Manager is a versatile java API, allowing to declaratively
register, acquire, and manage dynamic OSGi services.

Getting Started
===============

To start using Apache Felix Dependency Manager, please go to our website and read the
various guides for users:

then please go to:

There are three ways to use Dependency Manager: you can use the original java API, the new lambda API, or the 
DM annotations.
